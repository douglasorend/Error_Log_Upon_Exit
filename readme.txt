[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
Ever get tired of having to refresh after making a change, just to find out if there are any errors in the error log?  

I did, so I wrote a mod consisting of several hooks to get the number of errors in the log and write it to the output buffer before it is sent to the user, thus allowing up-to-date error log counts [b]AFTER[/b] all source and template processing has taken place!
